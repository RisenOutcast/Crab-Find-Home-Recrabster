# Crab Find Home Recrabster
Topdown 2D waveclearing game. Originally made in Finnish Game Jam 2019 and now enhanced, refined and completed in 2021.

# Gameplay
You face increasingly harder waves, enemies drop their shells which can be used to unlock new attacks.
The new version enchances the previous features while adding new ones:
* Boss Battle
* Points system
* Leaderboards
* Settings Menu
* Fixes and quality-of-life improvements

The points system gives points depending on enemies defeated (later types of enemies give more points), how many shells you have in the end and you'll lose points if you take damage.
